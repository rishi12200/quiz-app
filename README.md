# Quiz Application
A responsive, single-page quiz application built with React, designed for an engaging and interactive learning experience. The app includes multiple question types such as multiple choice and true/false, with a timer-based flow for added challenge. Questions are sourced from a local JavaScript file, and the app automatically progresses to the next question, displaying the correct answer briefly for real-time feedback.

# Key Features

Automatic Progression: Moves to the next question automatically after displaying the answer.
Real-Time Feedback: Provides immediate feedback on answers.
Timer-Based Flow: Adds a timing element for each question, increasing engagement.
