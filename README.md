Quiz Application
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

<code>npm start
Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.
The page will reload if you make edits, and you may see lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

npm run build
Builds the app for production in the build folder.
It optimizes the React build for the best performance, with minified code and hashed filenames for deployment.

npm run eject
Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you canâ€™t go back!
If needed, this command lets you fully customize the configuration by copying dependencies like webpack, Babel, and ESLint directly into your project.
