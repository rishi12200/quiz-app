# Getting Started with Quiz App
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

# Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start: Runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits, and you may see lint errors in the console.

npm test: Launches the test runner in watch mode.

npm run build: Builds the app for production in the build folder. It optimizes React for the best performance with minified code and hashed filenames, making it ready for deployment.

npm run eject: If necessary, you can run this command to gain full control over the build setup. Note that this is a one-way operation and is irreversible.
