# Quiz Application
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

# Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

<code>npm start</code>

Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.
The page will reload if you make edits, and you may see lint errors in the console.

<code>npm test</code>
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

<code>npm run build</code>
Builds the app for production in the build folder.
It optimizes the React build for the best performance, with minified code and hashed filenames for deployment.

<code>npm run eject</code>
Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you canâ€™t go back!
If needed, this command lets you fully customize the configuration by copying dependencies like webpack, Babel, and ESLint directly into your project.
